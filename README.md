Step counter app for Android
============================

This is a step counter app for Android based on [this algorithm](https://github.com/4YP/Java-Step-Counter).
The algorithm performs a peak detection on the data coming from the accelerometers.

The app runs the algorithm and shows the results.
It also connects to the Arduino-based ground truth device explained here and dumps all the data on a CSV file.
